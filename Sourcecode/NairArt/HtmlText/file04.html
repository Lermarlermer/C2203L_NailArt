            <p>Nails take a beating, so it's important to teach your child how to care for them. Teaching your child the
                following tips from dermatologists can help your child develop healthy nail-care habits.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Keep nails trimmed.&nbsp;</strong>Short nails stay cleaner and break less often.
                Dermatologists recommend that an adult trim a child’s nails until the child is about 9 or 10 years old.
                At about that age, children can trim their own nails if they feel comfortable doing so.</p>
            <p><strong>How to trim fingernails and toenails:</strong> When your child is ready to trim his or her own
                nails, you should teach your child the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Trim nails after taking a bath or shower. Nails are softer then, so trimming is easier.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use a nail clipper or nail scissors to trim nails.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Cut fingernails almost straight across. Round a little at the corners to keep the nails strong.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Cut toenails straight across. This reduces the chance of getting an ingrown nail.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Smooth rough edges with a nail file or emery board. Always pull the file across the nail in the
                        same direction. Filing back and forth can weaken nails.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Leave the cuticles alone. Cuticles protect the nail root, so it's best to not cut or push back
                        the cuticles.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. Dry the hands well.</strong>Teaching children to dry their hands well is important. If nails
                stay wet for a while, a nail infection can develop.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Rub lotion on the fingernails.&nbsp;</strong>Nails need moisturizing to keep them flexible.
                The best time to apply lotion is immediately after washing the hands and after taking a bath or shower.
                This is especially important when the air is dry. Dry nails split more easily.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Limit the use of nail-polish remover to twice a month.</strong>&nbsp;Nail-polish remover is
                extremely drying. Try to find a remover without acetone, which is especially hard on the nails.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Eat foods that contain plenty of protein and vitamin B7 (also called
                    biotin).</strong>&nbsp;Meat, fish, milk, walnuts, almonds, and eggs are rich in protein and vitamin
                B7. These foods help to keep nails healthy and strong.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Take care of hangnails right away — and the right way.&nbsp;</strong>Chewing or tearing off
                that hanging bit of skin can cause an infection. To take care of a hangnail, dermatologists recommend:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Wash your hands well with soap and water.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use a nail clipper or nail scissors to cut off the hanging bit of skin.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>7. Prevent toenail problems with good nail care.&nbsp;</strong>Just because toenails are often
                out of sight does not mean they should be out of mind. Following these dermatologists' tips can help
                keep toenails healthy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>When buying shoes, leave wiggle room for toes. Your child's shoes should have plenty of room for
                        toes. Cramped toes can lead to painful ingrown toenails.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Change socks daily. Clean socks help safeguard foot health. Dirty socks can lead to toenail
                        infections.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Wear flip-flops rather than going barefoot in public places. Walking barefoot in public places
                        can lead to a toenail infection, athlete's foot, or plantar warts. Protect your feet by wearing
                        flip-flops or shower sandals in public places, such as beaches, pools, locker rooms, camps, and
                        hotel bathrooms (including showers and tubs).</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>8. Check your nails.&nbsp;</strong>Children's nails are usually healthy, but teaching them to
                check their nails at a young age develops a healthy habit. Checking nails is important because the first
                sign of health problem can show up in a nail. These signs include a dark streak and a nail that starts
                to crumble and fall off. If either happens, it's time to see a dermatologist.</p>
