                            <p>Nail biting typically begins in childhood and can continue through adulthood, and the
                                side effects can be more than cosmetic. Repeated nail biting can make the skin around
                                your nails feel sore, and it can damage the tissue that makes nails grow, resulting in
                                abnormal-looking nails. To help you stop biting your nails, dermatologists recommend
                                following these tips.</p>

            <p>Nail biting typically begins in childhood and can continue through adulthood, and the side effects can be
                more than cosmetic. Repeated nail biting can make the skin around your nails feel sore, and it can
                damage the tissue that makes nails grow, resulting in abnormal-looking nails. Chronic nail biting can
                also leave you vulnerable to infection as you pass harmful bacteria and viruses from your mouth to your
                fingers and from your nails to your face and mouth.</p>
            <p>To help you stop biting your nails, dermatologists recommend the following tips:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Keep your nails trimmed short.</strong> Having less nail provides less to bite and is
                        less tempting.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Apply bitter-tasting nail polish to your nails. </strong>Available over-the-counter, this
                        safe, but awful-tasting formula discourages many people from biting their nails.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Get regular manicures.</strong> Spending money to keep your nails looking attractive may
                        make you less likely to bite them. Alternatively, you can also cover your nails with tape or
                        stickers or wear gloves to prevent biting.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Replace the nail-biting habit with a good habit.</strong> When you feel like biting your
                        nails, try playing with a stress ball or silly putty instead. This will help keep your hands
                        busy and away from your mouth.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Identify your triggers.</strong> These could be physical triggers, such as the presence
                        of hangnails, or other triggers, such as boredom, stress, or anxiety. By figuring out what
                        causes you to bite your nails, you can figure out how to avoid these situations and develop a
                        plan to stop. Just knowing when you’re inclined to bite may help solve the problem.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Try to gradually stop biting your nails. </strong>Some doctors recommend taking a gradual
                        approach to break the habit. Try to stop biting one set of nails, such as your thumb nails,
                        first. When that’s successful, eliminate your pinky nails, pointer nails, or even an entire
                        hand. The goal is to get to the point where you no longer bite any of your nails.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>For some people, nail biting may be a sign of a more serious psychological or emotional problem. If
                you’ve repeatedly tried to quit and the problem persists, consult a doctor. If you bite your nails and
                develop a skin or nail infection, <a href="https://www.aad.org/find-a-derm" title="">consult a
                    board-certified dermatologist</a>.</p>
